# Not a long time ago in a galaxy not too far away

## Talking about GBKFIT

### A tool for galaxy kinematic modelling

## Astronomy 101

-   A galaxy is a bunch of stars and dust
-   They can come as a (boring) elliptical, or an exciting spiral
-   They can be pretty big

## Galaxy Kinematics

The study of motion for a galaxy, by studying the kinematics of galaxies, can understand more about the pysics of galaxys

-   Modelling is used to abstract certain pysical properties and behaviours of the galaxies
-   Take data
-   Run model
-   Assess error
-   Repeat until parameters are 'good enough'
-   Then use model for science!

## Challenges

Need a fast and flexible software, no one piece of software can handle all cases.

## About Astronomers

1. Astronemers are not comupters scientists
2. Focus on papers before software
3. Do not follow codng conventions
4. Loves outdated software
